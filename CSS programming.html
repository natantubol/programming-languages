    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the cornerstone of web design. It transforms plain HTML structures into visually captivating websites. Itâ€™s a language that allows web developers and designers to dictate the appearance of HTML elements.

    </p>
    
<p>Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage, providing the basic content blocks. CSS is the stylish outfit, the makeup, and the overall aesthetic that brings the webpage to life. With CSS, you can control:

</p>

<ol>- Colors and Fonts: Change text color, size, and typeface.
</ol>
<ol>- Layout: Build multi-column designs, position elements exactly where you want them, and create layouts that seamlessly adapt to any screen size.
</ol>
<ol>-Backgrounds: Add background images or colors.
</ol>
<ol>-Animations and Transitions: Create smooth visual effects to enhance user interaction.
</ol>
<ol>- Add Interactive Touches: Incorporate subtle shadows, smooth transitions, and animations to engage and delight your visitors.
</ol>
<p>CSS makes websites visually appealing and user-friendly. Its key advantage lies in its separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This means you can update styles across an entire website with minimal changes to the code.  This efficiency saves time and makes website maintenance a breeze.</p>
<p>In short, if HTML builds the house, CSS paints the walls, decorates the rooms, and makes it a place you want to spend time in.
